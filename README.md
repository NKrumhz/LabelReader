# LabelReader
All of the programs written for my senior design project 

MainProgram.py is the final program that will be used to run the Label application system 

Alignment.py is a variation of the MainProgram.py that allows for the manual adjustment
of the position of the labels in order to make sure they are centered in the view of the camera. 

QRCodeReader.py is the state of the code after sprint 2, with a program that can read an image from 
either file or a webcam, and return/save any QR codes in the images. 

ParellelMotorDriver.py is a separate program at the end of sprint 3, the program uses multithreading to 
control multiple motors independently of each other, allowing for greater flexability of the system.
